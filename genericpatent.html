							<h1>Quality Optimizer and Clay 3D Printer Device for Modeling Concept Mock-up</h1>
							
							<p>Project Duration: Nov 2023 – Present</p>
							
						
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/patent 3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>As far as the process of turning an initial idea into a conceptual muck-up is concerned, the invention is within the category of conceptual muck-up design. One of the most significant design stages that most designers, especially architects, encounter with this issue is creating conceptual muck-up out of the idea. The idea's conversion into a muck-up can be so crucial that it can alter the ultimate design outcome and produce an entirely new design in the end.
								Issues that can arise during the idea-to-concept conversion process include:
								</p>
							<p>•	Inability of the designer to visualize an idea as a volumetric muck-up
								•	The material's lack of flexibility or appropriate stiffness concerning the intended design
								•	Time limit of projects
								•	Inadequate quality of conceptual muck-ups
								•	Throwing away and not being able to reuse materials for future projects
								•	High waste of material to make each conceptual model muck-up
								•	Economic inefficiency of using new materials to create multiple volume models for both new and ongoing tasks.
								</p>
							<p>Considering the problems caused by the traditional process of converting a mental idea into a conceptual muck-up and the impact it has on costs, project quality, and the environment, the claimed invention facilitates this process, sustainability, and environment preservation. it also optimizes time and costs, and the final quality of the project.</p>
							<p>In addition, this device helps the designer to create the idea in the form of a volume model by converting the designer's idea into a conceptual model by utilizing 3D software and 3D printing to transform the designer's idea into a conceptual model, this device expedites the design process and gives the designer plenty of high-quality conceptual model muck-ups in an optimized period. It is also challenging to choose the ideal material to generate a mental image because of the materials' lack of flexibility or suitable stiffness concerning the design's potential. Because of this, the claimed invention is created by processing clay material, modifying the mass proportion of input materials' composition, and adding additives based on the designer's requirements. This method will help in the creation of high-quality conceptual model muck-ups.</p>
							<p>Moreover, with the help of artificial intelligence, this device is customized for the designer in such a way that, following the creation of each conceptual muck-up model, it is evaluated and scored by the user. Afterward, it attempts to enhance its performance with the passage of time and the receipt of the data set from the completed inspections. It modifies the mass proportion and composition of additives and raw materials to the designer's expectations, which are impacted by the designer's style and the material's capability.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, this device contributes to environmental sustainability because of clay's biocompatibility feature, also the clay can be reused to create conceptual models for future projects, and it reduces the amount of material waste. This gadget can also significantly affect economic sustainability in terms of material cost balance and reusability. Thus, taking into account that the majority of the muck-ups created during the project are wasted and thrown away when the project is finished. This device employs an approach to the content that is both economically and environmentally sustainable.</p>
